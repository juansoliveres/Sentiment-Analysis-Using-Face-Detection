# Sentiment analysis using face detection.

The goal of this project is to apply python's tensorflow library to build a system capable of classifying facial expression into 1 of 7 categories: Sad, Happy, Neutral, Angry, Disgust, Surprise and Fear. In order to do so, we will construct a Convolutional Neural Network and train it by means of a GPU to speed up the process. We will compare our CNN with an in-built python library called FER that has the same objective. Our objective here is to improve FER's precision when classifying expresions, or at least obtain a benchmark to compare the accuracy obtained by our model.
